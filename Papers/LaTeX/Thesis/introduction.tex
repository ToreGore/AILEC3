\section{Introduction}\label{sect:intro}

The widespread adoption of \textit{cloud computing} services in the last few years has led to a significant increase in the energy consumption 
of \textit{data centers}, which has become a critical concern for cloud providers. 
While cloud computing offers many benefits, such as cost savings and scalability, 
the energy consumption associated with it has negative implications both from an environmental and financial perspective. 
As the demand for cloud services continues to grow, the energy consumption of data centers is expected to increase exponentially, 
further exacerbating the issue.

The optimization of resource allocation in \textit{cloud computing environments} is a complex problem that involves a large number of variables and constraints. 
The main objective is to minimize energy consumption while maintaining or improving the performance of the services. 
Achieving this goal is challenging due to the scale of cloud computing infrastructures, the dynamic nature of workloads, and the need to provide 24/7 availability. 
Given these challenges, cloud providers face the dilemma of how to maintain high-quality service delivery while reducing energy consumption.~\cite{yusoh2012composite}

\textit{Artificial Intelligence} (AI) techniques, such as \textit{neural networks} and \textit{genetic algorithms}~\cite{mitchell1998introduction, yusoh2012composite, rafique2011cloud, nzanywayingoma2017effective}, 
have been widely studied as a method for addressing this problem.

Genetic algorithms are a type of optimization algorithm that mimic the process of natural evolution and use heuristic techniques to find near-optimal solutions 
for complex problems. They are well suited for solving problems that involve a large number of variables and constraints, 
such as the resource allocation problem in cloud computing. 
They can explore a large search space in a relatively short amount of time, enabling them to find near-optimal solutions even 
when faced with incomplete or uncertain information.~\cite{forrest1996genetic}

The use of genetic algorithms in cloud computing has the potential to significantly improve the energy efficiency of data centers while maintaining or improving performance. 
By optimizing resource allocation, genetic algorithms can reduce the number of servers and storage devices required to run a given workload, 
which in turn reduces energy consumption. Additionally, genetic algorithms can adapt to changes in workload and resource usage patterns, 
further improving the energy efficiency of the data center.

One of the key challenges of measuring energy consumption in cloud computing is identifying the power consumption of the various components of the system, 
such as servers, storage devices, and network devices. 
The energy consumption of these components is typically measured in watt-hours (Wh) or joules (J). 
The energy consumption of a data center can be measured at different levels of granularity, from individual servers to entire racks or data centers. 
One of the most commonly used metrics for measuring energy consumption in cloud computing is \textit{Power Usage Effectiveness} (PUE). 
PUE is a ratio of the total energy consumed by a data center to the energy consumed by the IT equipment. 
A PUE of 1.0 indicates that all of the energy consumed by the data center is used by the IT equipment, while a PUE of greater than 1.0 
indicates that some of the energy is being used for other purposes, such as cooling and lighting.~\cite{uchechukwu2014energy}

Despite the advantages of using genetic algorithms for resource allocation in cloud computing, there are also limitations to consider. 
One of the main limitations is the computational expense of genetic algorithms, particularly when the problem size is large. 
The resource allocation problem in cloud computing environments can involve a large number of variables and constraints, 
which can make the computational cost of genetic algorithms quite high. This can make them impractical for certain types of problems or when resources are limited. 
Additionally, genetic algorithms are often sensitive to the choice of parameters and initial conditions. This can make it difficult to obtain consistent and reliable results, 
as the choice of parameters and initial conditions can have a significant impact on the performance of the algorithm.~\cite{dillon2010cloud, sajid2013cloud}

The selection of suitable parameters and initial conditions is an important step in the implementation of genetic algorithms. 
It requires a significant amount of expertise and experience to choose the appropriate parameters and initial conditions that will lead to good performance. 
Furthermore, the results obtained from genetic algorithms are probabilistic in nature, which means that multiple runs of the algorithm are typically required 
to obtain a stable and robust solution. This can increase the computational cost and time required to obtain a solution, which can be a limitation when resources are limited.

In addition to computational expense and sensitivity to parameters, genetic algorithms also have some other limitations such as the lack of guarantee of global optima, 
and the risk of getting stuck in local optima. Genetic algorithms are also not suitable for problems with deterministic solutions. 
Furthermore, the stochastic nature of genetic algorithms may also lead to a lack of reproducibility of results. 
These limitations must be taken into account when deciding to implement genetic algorithms in cloud computing environments.

However, the potential benefits of using genetic algorithms in cloud computing outweigh the limitations. 
Genetic algorithms have the potential to significantly improve the energy efficiency of data centers while maintaining or improving performance. 
By optimizing resource allocation, genetic algorithms can reduce the number of servers and storage devices required to run a given workload, 
which in turn reduces energy consumption. Additionally, genetic algorithms can adapt to changes in workload and resource usage patterns, 
further improving the energy efficiency of the data center.

To effectively use genetic algorithms in cloud computing, cloud providers need to carefully evaluate the trade-offs between the potential benefits and limitations of using these algorithms. 
Cloud providers must consider the specific characteristics of the problem at hand, the computational resources and expertise available, 
and the potential benefits of using genetic algorithms in their environment. 
The use of genetic algorithms requires a significant amount of expertise and experience to choose the appropriate parameters and initial conditions 
that will lead to good performance. Cloud providers must have a thorough understanding of the characteristics of the problem they are trying to solve, 
and they must be prepared to invest significant time and resources in the development and implementation of genetic algorithms.
