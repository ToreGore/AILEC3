\section{State of the Art}\label{sect:sota}

The use of genetic algorithms for optimizing resource allocation in cloud computing environments 
to reduce energy consumption while maintaining or improving performance is an active area of research. 
While genetic algorithms have shown promising results in reducing energy consumption, there are still limitations to consider, 
such as computational expense, sensitivity to parameters, and the lack of guarantee of global optima. 
Ongoing research in this area is focused on addressing these limitations and developing more effective techniques 
for optimizing resource allocation in cloud computing environments using genetic algorithms. 
Therefore, the state-of-the-art regarding the use of genetic algorithms for saving energy in cloud computing is still evolving.
