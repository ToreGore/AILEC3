\section{The Problem}\label{sect:problem}

The problem here described is a problem of optimization. 
The goal is to find an acceptable solution by using a genetic algorithm to the assignation of a set of processes to a set of servers.
The problem is defined as follows:\\
A Servers $s$ has a CPU speed $cs$, calculated in Gigahertz (GHz) and a number of CPUs $cn$.\\
A Process $p$ has a length $l$, calculated in number of instructions.\\
A Solution $sol$ is a collection of tuples $(s_n, [p_1, p_2, ..., p_m])_{n}$ where $s_n$ is the $n^{th}$ Server of the tuple 
and $[p_1, p_2, ..., p_m]$, with variable $m$ for each tuple, is a list of Processes.\\
Let's define, for a Server, the following functions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $cs(s)$: CPU speed of the Server $s$;
    \item $cn(s)$: Number of CPUs of the Server $s$.\\
\end{itemize}
For a process, we define the following function:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $l(p)$: Length of the Process $p$.\\
\end{itemize}

For a solution $sol$, The fitness function $f$ of $sol$ is defined as follows:
\begin{equation}
    \label{fitness}
    f(sol) = \sqrt{\sum_{0}^{n}{(\sum_{0}^{m}l(p_m) * (cs(s_n) * cn(s_n)))^2}}
\end{equation}
%$$f(sol) = \sqrt{\sum_{0}^{n}{(\sum_{0}^{m}l(p_m) * (cs(s_n) * cn(s_n)))^2}}$$
